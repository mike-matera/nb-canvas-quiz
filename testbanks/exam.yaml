title: CIS-15 Final Spring 2024

description: | 
    Welcome to the CIS-15 midterm. Please read all of the instructions. 
    You will be asked to write functions. There's a checker program that 
    you can use to make sure that your functions are correct. Instructions 
    for the checker program are the same as the practice midterm. If you 
    haven't done the practice you should stop and do it first. See below 
    for a link to download the exam notebook.

    ## Partial Credit

    Partial credit will be given to all questions. You should attempt an 
    answer to each question and submit your work even if the checker program 
    finds problems with your answer. At minimum you should have a function 
    with a docstring that takes the correct arguments. 

    ## Submitting Answers

    The last question asks you to upload your notebook file. The code in 
    your file is the only code that is graded. It doesn't matter what 
    you put in the other answer fields. 

    ## Code of Conduct

    You are allowed to use your notes, your book and the internet to 
    find answers to the questions. Each question can be answered 
    using only commands and syntax that you have been shown in class. 
    Do not work in teams or use other people's answers. The use of A.I. 
    coding assistants, for example ChatGPT, is not allowed.

    Once you begin the test you have three hours to submit your code.
